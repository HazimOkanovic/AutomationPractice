This is a project that I started while practicing test automation. There are different regression tests, as well as some other tests that I wanted to make.

The project is made for a website name Automationpractice (http://automationpractice.com/index.php). It tests the core functions of the mentioned website – items buying, signing up, and logging in.

For regression testing, I have written various test cases regarding logging in, logging out,and signing up. 

There are also four test regarding different paths a user might use when buying items.
